Bali's reputation for offering a total escape continues to draw international visitors to the gorgeous destination in droves.

There are opportunities for any travel budget, not to mention the most popular activity (hanging out on a beach) won't cost you a thing. The white and black sands that line each beach on this island in Indonesia are as stunning as the waves that crash into them.

Each has its own perks so visitors of all types should be able to find one to fall in love with. Surfers travel from all over the world to challenge their skills.

For die-hards, Balangan Beach's waters can get so rough that non-surfers are often advised to stay near the shore. The nearby cliffs offer breathtaking views.

For adventurers, there are plenty of hidden beaches waiting to be found. Karma Beach and Nyang Nyang require hefty treks on rough terrain, but the outcome is worth the effort. Both are largely isolated and left unattended throughout the year, so it's almost like having your own private beach.

No matter your preference, Bali is stocked with wonderful beaches. We've highlighted 14 of them in the gallery atop this story.

### Balangan Beach
he waves can get high at this beach, making it popular with surfers. Rough water and a sharp ocean floor mean most beach-goers are happy to admire the view.

### Bias Tugal
This beach is accessible only through a rough and rocky path, but the effort is worth it. You'll practically have the white sand, coconut trees and turquoise water to yourself.

### Bingin Beach
White limestone cliffs are a dramatic contrast to the blue waters at this small surfing beach on Bali's Bukit Peninsula. Visitors can stay in everything from surfing camps to boutique resorts and private villas.

### Karma Beach
The descent to this exclusive beach is made via funicular (for a small fee) rather than by stairs. Services include cocktails and shaded lounge chairs -- the area belongs to a high-end beach club open to the public.

### Dreamland Beach
Many have been deterred by the major resorts popping up around Dreamland, but the soft-sand beach itself is still worth a visit.

### Jimbaran Beach
Jimbaran Beach sits on Bali's southwestern coast, where the mainland connects to the Bukit Peninsula. It's home to luxury resorts like the Four Seasons and the Intercontinental. Restaurants line the shore with tables on the sand.

### Kuta Beach
Kuta sits in a bustling resort town that was once a quiet fishing village. Now, surfers and party hounds from around the world come to ride the long waves and hit the clubs.

### Nyang Nyang
Yet another beach that requires some work to get to. Once you find the gate, you'll walk down a series of stairs before emerging at the deserted beach. There are no showers, no restrooms, no vendors.

### Padang Padang Beach
"Eat, Pray, Love" fans may recognize this beach as the place where Julia Roberts' character meets her love interest. The water is safe to swim and the surf is some of the most exciting in all of Indonesia.

### Sanur Beach
Though not as touristy as Kuta, Sanur is filled with beachfront resorts. Yet its small fishing village charm is still intact, with local warungs holding their own against luxury hotels.

### Geger Beach
The surrounding area is filled with five-star resorts like the St. Regis Bali and the Mulia. The water is typically calm, which makes rental kayaks, dinghies and paddleboards hot commodities.
